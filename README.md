Overview of the current MVP

Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as of now is created to test the feasibility of a carbon credit aggregation
platform targeted for MSME industries such as agricultural industries, manufacturing sector, renewable energy
industries, and waste management plants. We have created an onboarding solution to get as many sellers on the
platform as possible in the first iteration.

Previous Lean Canvas Iterations –
• Initial Model: Our initial Lean Canvas (dated 19-01-2025) focused on decarbonization services for energy
industries and consultancies, emphasizing carbon tracking, compliance reporting, and cost optimization for
large corporate enterprises.
• First Pivot: Based on customer interviews, we shifted to a carbon credit aggregation model that enables
MSMEs to access carbon credit markets by simplifying registration, compliance, and sales and connecting
them with the corporate buyers.
• Second Pivot (Current MVP): After analyzing survey responses, we further narrowed our target segments to
focus exclusively on MSMEs in industries that can generate carbon credits, such as agriculture related,
renewable energy, manufacturing sector and waste management plants. The final lean canvas we referred to is
attached in the appendix
After these multiple iterations and refinements, we decided on the first MVP as an informative video followed by a
survey and a website (WIP) that explains to the target customers:
• What carbon emissions are and their impact on MSMEs, farmers, and solar rooftop installations.
• The potential of carbon credit markets and how MSMEs can benefit.
• How Green Guava Co. can help businesses participate in the carbon credit market.

Post this, we provided a survey to test the key hypotheses which we will look at in the next section. The survey
responses help us refine our approach and future iterations.
Hypotheses to be tested
• Are customers aware? - We are testing the hypothesis that at least 60% of MSMEs in our target industries were
not aware of carbon credit trading and lacked knowledge on how to participate.
• Are customers willing to adopt the GGC model? - Here, we want to test if at least 30% of the MSMEs we
engage with during the MVP phase will express interest in adopting the Green Guava Co. platform for carbon
credit tracking and sales.
The results from the survey show that both the hypotheses we tested are true with more than 70% of the responses
not aware of how to use the carbon credit trading systems. For the 2nd hypothesis, we observed that more than 90%
customers willing to sell these carbon credits with more than 50% willing to onboard themselves on the GGC
platform. We will further use the website responses to further test the 2nd hypothesis.
MVP Elements
We have created the MVP which includes core elements that we used to test the hypothesis. We have attached the
video link, survey results and website link in the appendix below:
• Informative Video: This is an informative and engaging pitch video highlighting the benefits for customers, how
to register, and the process overview.
• Industry Survey: A structured survey for MSMEs to assess their awareness, interest, and willingness to
participate in the platform is provided as a follow up along with the video.
• Web-based Platform (WIP): Currently, we have created a basic portal for MSMEs to register their carbon credit
projects which contains the following main elements –
o Carbon Credit Tracking Dashboard: Provides visibility into generated and sold carbon credits (to be
introduced in the next iteration).
o Simplified Certification Process: MSMEs can submit compliance documents for review.
Execution Plan and Future steps
• Distribute the MVP Elements: Share the pitch video and survey with target customers.
• Analyze Survey Data: Measure awareness and willingness to adopt the GGC model.
• Onboard Initial Customers: Provide free access to the web platform for early adopters.
• Evaluate Data: Measure survey responses, registration rates, and website funnels.
• Collect Feedback: Gather insights from early users and assess engagement levels
Metrics to be tracked – Conversion rate from video to survey; #companies interested; #companies onboarded.
We understand that areas for improvement for us include the need for deeper education among MSMEs for carbon
credit trading and the need for development of high level of trust between GGC and the customers for a
sustainable relationship in the long term. The next MVP iterations will include the following steps that will consider
learnings from our MVP and survey results –
• Introduction of a Carbon Credit Tracker for Sellers that aligns with international carbon credit guidelines.
• Partnering with Corporate Buyers to enable direct carbon credit transactions.
• Onboarding onto Vera for industry-recognized verification and certification.
• Referral system for current customers to board their peers on to the platform with correct incentives
• Refining and Iterating based on user feedback, improving platform usability and business model effectiveness.
Assumptions
• MSMEs are willing to pay up to 5-10% of their carbon credit revenue for certification and sales facilitation.
• Corporate buyers are willing to pay market-competitive prices if the credits are verified and scalable.
• MSMEs generating 100+ (for now) carbon credits annually are the primary target as of now.
